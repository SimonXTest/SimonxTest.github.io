A lot of people have an online username or nickname they go by, it can be useful in many ways. It's unique, memorable, short, and it makes you look better in some places.

I have an online username (as everyone does). I don't want to make it obvious that it's me though, I am pretty sure people can figure it out on their own if they look hard enough. I don't mind if you find out, some people already had.

What about my face? That's the only thing I try to hide. I don't tell anyone to not post my pictures, feel free. I personally don't feel comfortable with certain websites having a picture of my face, I think some websites can be very invasive and intrusive to an uncomfortable extent (it would be okay to post it on this blog). That's how some machines work. I still won't post it here, I mean it's odd, why do you want to look at my face? An employer could treat me unfairly based on my looks, or the color of my skin, it could be good or bad. I don't want this.

I won't ever have my face as a profile picture and I won't ever post it myself. Someone else can, because if someone else does it then it's not making it very easy for people to find it. Heck even tag me if you want, tag my username, it's fine

# I want to start making Youtube tutorials.

I think making a channel for Youtube tutorials would be nice. I had looked at some of the resources I use and I don't think there are any tutorials around. My plan is to make a website and a youtube channel where I can teach people how to do tech related things, the videos would be very short and simple and the priority with each video is

**Perfection**

Don't get me wrong. I don't obssess over being a perfectionist. I will obssess with this channel though. People are very prone to mistakes when they make tutorials, I am prone to mistakes as well, I have to do a lot of retakes to get a tutorial right. I don't think most channels are aiming for perfectionism, and I think that my idea of perfectionism will make me stand out. Not only that, but it's also going to be a challenge, a very difficult challenge that may be overwhelming (planning will be the most overwhelming part). I would do a lot of retakes

I would also make a lot of *very* short videos. 10-60 seconds long. Very simple explanations on how to do very basic things. I could just make one video talking about every basic thing about a software, but this might be useful for someone. There are still going to be longer tutorial videos, but there are going to be a lot of short ones as well (they are very easy to make)

I even have my avatar planned out! my character, I just need to set it up. I also had planned out the music I am going to use for this channel, please listen to it here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZx7QBDDxDPLsUSfaHP4-5oSWXtXFuQeP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZx7QBDDxDPLsUSfaHP4-5oSWXtXFuQeP)

Another idea I have is to make speedrun tutorials, rushed tutorials. That may not be a good idea though. I might not make them, but if I do, they are going to be rare and mainly for entertainment purposes.

# More info?

I don't know, I don't want to fill the homepage with information about me. This is the last post I'll make talking about me. I'll make a list of fun facts

- A lot of people think that I speak english natively, and I am from the US, Canada, Europe, or some other english speaking country. I am not, I speak spanish, and it's not easy to guess where I am from (but you'll catch some hints in the accent and get it eventually)
- It's very easy for me to learn things and figure them out hands on, it can be more difficult if it's with a teacher though
- I do a lot of documentation for my programs
- I like gaming. Everyone does. I am more of a pc gamer, but I have console
- You like old things? Old movies, old videogames, etc. I also do
- Most people think they know me, but they don't
- I really like costumes, I rarely wear them though
- I like almost everything
- My nails are amazing (I don't do pedicure or any treatment)
- Water is mvp

# About My Middle Name

Fun fact about my middle name, "X".

I always include the initials of my middle name everywhere, which can seem odd or out of place for some. I don't do this for any cultural reasons. You see, me and my father share the same first and last name, it's not rare but it doesn't seem like a lot of people are aware that some parents do this. This has lead to a lot of issues when it came to communication and legal documents, it's a waste of time, because of this to truly differentiate myself from my father, I always have to include my middle name. The issues at times can go as far as companies even allowing me to commit identity fraud, because they think I am my father when I tell them my name and other information. It also allows me to take actions on his behalf. It's pretty unlikely that I'll get in trouble, since he's my father, it's not intentional, and it's nothing malicious, but it's still very weird and odd.
Also, whenever I am credited, I want the credits of my work to go to me, not my father.

There are no exceptions, I always include the initials somehow, you never know when whoever knows me must contact my father, or a matter has to get both of us involved at the same time. I don't usually include the full middle name because that can also lead to confusion ("Is that your last name?" They are less likely to think that if it's an initial).

**In short words: I always include my middle name initial because it makes life easier for everybody. It distinguishes me from my father.**

I don't have plans to change my name, I don't want to. It was suggested that I call myself "Simon jr" or "Simon The 2nd", and to that I say, no.

Sometimes I make up a name on the spot if it makes life easier somehow (example, when me and my father are involved on a matter). Denis Tea is a common nickname, as well as Ben Cave.

Should I give my full name on this website? Could that have negative repercussions in the future? Maybe, I am not sure. All you are going to get is Simon X Camilo, if you want the full name you can ask through another medium (not the comments).
